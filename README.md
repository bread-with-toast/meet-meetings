# Meet Meetings

## How to install?

Find the executable in target/release/meet-meetings.exe and run `.\meet-meetings.exe` from the command line if you trust this application. If you use `meet-meetings.exe`, you may get a warning.

You can also find the executable in the releases.

**You may need to install the sourc code and Rust to run the executable**

I plan to add more information soon.
